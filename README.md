This repo is created to organise some work of extracting and managing Russian economic statistics (macroeconomics, corporate reports, bank report forms). My intent is to revitalise work on several stalled data-mining projects using what I learned in programming recently and help from some young talent and more experienced people. 

Plan of work
============

EP (15/06/2017): 
- writeup below
- keep everyone synced/informed

Team (15/06/2017):
- introduce yourself in [#1](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/data-team-ru-stat/issues/1) - breifly your background and what you can expect to learn
- join [openstat-team](https://join.slack.com/openstat-team/shared_invite/MTk4MTUzODM3NTM4LTE0OTc1MTczODctMThhNTE3Yzc1NA) on Slack
- glance at <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/mini-kep> and <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/data-rosstat-kep> 
- read through <http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/> 

To cover here
=============

**Intro**
- case for machine-readable data in economic analysis eg. [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)
- some previous background and lessons learned + experience at Upwork
- user case and design considerations  

**List of repos**

Active developement:
- <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/mini-kep> that supercedes <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/data-rosstat-kep>

Stalled:
- any other data\*-something repo at <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/>

**Must read**
- <http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/> - some bias towards machine learning/larger data, but very useful 
to understand separation of parts of code and pipeline form raw immutable data

**Team**
- who is who and expectations from project, see [#1](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/data-team-ru-stat/issues/1) 
- maybe need to bring in some more experienced people

**Skillbase**
- very modular checks to make sure everyone know common things needed for collaborative work 
- suggestiong for learning
- resumes, github profiles and self-presentation 

**Language**
- code comments are English-only
- Issues and documentation may be in Russian (sometimes you have to express yourself), 
  but keep in mind English-only team members
- I think it is best to provide a small summary (sentence or two of just a topic) if you write something in Russian

**Terms of work**
- open to people interested in learning and sharing better practice in ETL/data analysis and Python programming
- some specific tasks are paid via Upwork

**Task ideas**
- unit testing <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/question-kep-unittest>
- compare subprojects (eg source, processed data, tests, docs, invokation, why stalled)
- model crawler

**More tasks/comments**
- channel @slack?

**Out of scope**
Some great ideas that are not immediately in the scope of this task:
- [eqcell](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/make-xls-eqcell) - generate simple Excel sheets by instruction
- frontends:
  - [datachart.cc](http://datachart.cc) - sample github.io/Jekyll page, 
  - [ckan](https://ckan.org/) - larger server to dessiminate open data
- <https://civic.io/2015/04/01/i-hate-open-data-portals/> + yandex open data talk (TODO: link)
